# Churn-Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **Churn Prediction Model** that analyzes customer data to predict the likelihood of customer churn. The notebook leverages machine learning techniques to identify patterns and deliver insights for better customer retention strategies.

## Project Overview

Customer churn, or attrition, refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn can help businesses retain customers by identifying at-risk individuals and intervening before they leave. This project focuses on developing a model that accurately predicts churn based on historical data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and evaluation
- Performance metrics for assessing the model

## File Structure
- `Churn Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the implementation of data loading, analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-prediction.git
   cd churn-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Churn Prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis and model.

## Data
The data for this project should be prepared beforehand and uploaded as necessary when prompted in the notebook. Ensure the data includes features such as customer demographic information, usage patterns, and historical data relevant to churn behavior.

## Model Evaluation
This notebook includes the following evaluation metrics to assess model performance:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC score

## Results
The model achieves accurate predictions of customer churn and provides key insights into features most important for determining churn. For specific results and analysis, refer to the output in the notebook.
